0. It's better to have a friend on this journey! A friend you love who is familiar with these concepts as well. My friend is Amirhossein Shirani, a talented and genius programmer/artist, and I‚Äôm really thankful for his presence and support. So, let's give a shoutout first to this lovely human being! ‚ù§Ô∏è
