# NEXT-JS: Zero to Hero

Hey fam! üòä In this repo, I share my journey to becoming a NEXT.JS master, so you can become one as well. üòé

0. It's better to have a friend on this journey! A friend you love who is familiar with these concepts as well. My friend is Amirhossein Shirani, a talented and genius programmer/artist, and I‚Äôm really thankful for his presence and support. So, let's give a shoutout first to this lovely human being! ‚ù§Ô∏è

1. At first, I noticed I couldn't learn much when I didn't know JavaScript. So, I found two YouTube courses designed for lazy designers like me who want to reach the good part (NEXT.JS) fast. üòä I‚Äôve included the links below:

   **JavaScript for Web Designers** (watch this first)(the first hour covers everything, the rest of the video isn't necessary(ihopeso:))):

   **All The JavaScript You Need To Know For React** (then watch this for the next step):
   [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m55PTVUrlnA&t=300s)

   **Asynchronous Javascript Tutorial - Promises and Async Await Explained** (learning these concepts would be nice before starting your react journey specially if you're planing to work with Api):
   [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgZ9npYJZzU)


   **Top 12 JavaScript Concepts to Know Before Learning React** (use this article as a cheat sheet along the way):

3-1. at this point I've predicted that I would be ready to dive into the NextJs but It's still confusing to me, so I've found out you need to know React and TypeScript as well before NextJs, So I've decided to take "Learn React Course" by codeacademy:

Here's another source which is awesome if you are a "texty" kind of guy :) :
